# Koch Snowflake Drawing in ROS2 Turtlesim

This ROS2 project utilizes the Turtlesim package to create an interactive demonstration of drawing the Koch Snowflake, a classic fractal shape. By implementing recursive algorithms and ROS2 communication protocols, we provide a visually engaging way to explore the principles of fractal geometry and robotic control. The project showcases the use of custom ROS2 services and topics to direct the turtlesim turtle in real-time, generating the intricate patterns of the Koch Snowflake with precision.
