# Koch Snowflake Drawing in ROS2 Turtlesim

This ROS2 project uses a tool called Turtlesim to show a cool shape called the Koch Snowflake. It's a kind of fractal, which means it has lots of interesting patterns. We make the Turtlesim turtle draw this shape using special instructions. The project is like a fun way to learn about cool math patterns and how robots can follow instructions. We use some special communication tools in ROS2 to make the turtle move in real-time and create the detailed patterns of the Koch Snowflake.
